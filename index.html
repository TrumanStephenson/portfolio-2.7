    <p>
      My name is Truman Stephenson.<br><br> I am born and raised in the lower 48 but my family is from South East Alaska. 
      We are Tlingit; Frog house of Raven Moiety. 
      I have been interested in Software Developement for several years now. 
      First starting with the intent to make video games, and learning C#. 
      But I have since grown from this and got into front-end software developement and learned useful 
      skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; and more recently, Java with the Codefy Foundation. 
      Take a look at all the progress so far!

      Yellow Cedar Tribute Page<br><br>This project was part of a compilation of 
      certificate projects to get certified for freecodecamp.org. 
      I wanted to dedicate it to the Alaskan Yellow Cedar. 
      It is slowly becomming an endagered species and if better precautions aren't take, 
      we could lose the tree in the coming years. So I wanted to commemorate it's existence eternally.

        Ecological Books, Landing Page<br><br>This is a landing page for some ecological books I have read and enjoyed. I wanted to showcase their descriptions for others to enjoy. The page even includes links to Amazon, in case someone is interested in purchasing one of them. This was also included as part of the certificate requirement.
